It's another cold day in the north. Large puffs of snow waft through the air,
vignetting the windows in icy white. There's no going out there today; we have
to stay inside.

Inside, where the fireplace crackles softly, bathing the room in a warm glow.
The rich walnut paneling on the walls soaks up the heat, to radiate it back long
into the night. A slowly melting cube of wax on the mantle fills the air with
the scent of lilacs and lavender. The screen on the wall is quietly playing some
movie or other.

Inside, where I recline on the couch draped in a warm sweater. On one side of
me, a bowl of yarn is gradually vanishing into the plaid blanket in my lap. On
the other side, my loving familiar slumbers into my elbow casting a peaceful
spell, her heartbeat a soft patter to match my own.

A gust of wind glances off the roof, adding the distant creaking of wood to the
soporific atmosphere. My familiar stirs at the noise, her long plush ears fall
into my chest as she burrows deeper into my arm. I mark my stitch, carefully
tucking the stray yarn back into its loaf. With a sigh, I perch the bowl on the
table, straighten the new fabric, and gently bring the little bunny around to my
chest. She seems to tug at my sweater as she settles, wrapping herself up
against my warmth.

She wins. Besides, I could use a short nap.
