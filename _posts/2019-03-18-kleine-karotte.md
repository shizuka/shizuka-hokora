**...seven months after first infection...**

A thin fog drifts lazily up from my nose, lingering for only a moment before the chill sweeps it away. My ears promptly lop tight against my back, regretting their foolish decision to stand up to listen. There isn't much life on the sidewalk, only the occasional stranger giving a sideways look from across the street. The fur on my neck bristles, my muscles tense. Though I command my body to keep walking normally, the instincts are asserting their dominance. They know what happens when I get too comfortable. Don't look, but don't shrink. If they think you're just a scared little bunny, they'll treat you like one.

Hunt you like one.

I pause at a crosswalk, my heart suddenly thrashing at my chest. It's been a month since you left all that behind, Shizuka. The race riots haven't reached the Pacific Northwest yet. You aren't the only anthro around, Seattle's too big a city for that. Just because you haven't met more than a few doesn't mean you're alone. These humans won't try anything in broad daylight. It will be okay.

My breath catches as I cross the empty street. It doesn't feel okay. I briefly avoid my reflection in a parked car, not wanting to think about how I stand almost level with the roof. Another burst of wind slices through my body, my fur blissfully ignoring its solemn duty to keep me warm. Fur can't insulate against fear. One block, two blocks, a third passes by until I reach my destination. A small pub, tucked away off the main streets, known on the local nets as a safe place for anthros like me to go. I tug on the door, and step inside.

There's a fire going today, fresh pine by the scent. I hang my coat by the door and wander to my usual table by the window, avoiding the glance of the handful of humans already here. Two men at the bar, one over there, three on the wall, one more at a table. The owner is behind the bar, he nods and smiles in my direction. I don't see anyone else, though, and for an instant I feel defeated. He fills two mugs, then taps on the corner of the wall.

There she is. A red vixen pokes her head through the kitchen curtains, then steps through with a smile. My ears perk, missing what she says to her boss, but catching the gentle clink of glass, the swish of her dress billowing out around her, tail wrapped around to keep it from getting away, the almost silent steps as she flows towards my table. Marina is her name. Marina Hasenkamp. Red fox anthro who shifted a few months before I even started sprouting fur. The woman who's made me feel a little at home in this city by the sea. She sets the mugs down, and glides into the bench across from me.

It's our third date.

She undoes a ribbon behind her head, letting her sandy hair collapse around her head, red ears poking straight up from the mess. My eyes drift down to the braided bracelets on her wrists, each more colorful than the last. To the white blouse puffing out from behind the blue corset, draping over her slender, furry arms. To her eyes, framed so perfectly by her face, infinite depths I could just fall into and never come back. Her giggle brings me back. She always lets me stare a little.

"How is *meine kleine Karotte* tonight?" she finally says, pushing a mug over to me.
