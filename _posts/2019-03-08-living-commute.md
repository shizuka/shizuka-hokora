The city breathes in.

I am one cell in thousands, coursing through its snow-choked arteries. Its silhouette stands in the distance, flat, as though it were a great billboard. Lights sparkle from its many towers. White mist lazily drifts from a dozen rooftops. The city's breath is shaky.

We pass under a bridge, round a corner, and suddenly I am in the city's heart. It is no longer a picture in the fog, but now a tight maze built of dizzyingly tall walls. The heart beats, I am discharged to the capillaries to hike my way to the next artery. Steel bones litter the veins, left behind by a long week of debauchery. No one else journeys with me, they've taken refuge inside. I reach the next nodule. The heart beats again, and I am whisked away.

The day passes, and I return to the city's heart. The sun casts long, warm shadows on its skin. Hundreds of cells like me await their ticket home, uneasy smoke rising from their mouths. The heart beats one more time, and we are pushed away from the city. Out to the great arteries that cover its surface. The lights recede into the distance, until the great billboard is just a bump of brightness on the horizon. We go home.

The city breathes out.
