The late September sun streaked through the window blinds, throwing thin bands
of shadow onto the bedroom wall. Birds filled the air with competing calls,
while a gentle fog blanketed the ground. Autumn was approaching the Georgia
countryside, bringing a chill to the morning air. A passing deer stopped to perk
its ears, then sprinted off into a forest at a loud noise coming from the house.

An arm darted out from under the covers, flailing around for the screaming alarm
clock on the table. The peaceful silence didn't last long. On the other table, a
phone started dancing loudly across the wood. A second arm pounced on the noisy
rectangle, bringing it up to a pillow with a muffled hello.

<!--more-->

"Hellooooo!" came a voice from the other end. No response. "Fletchy! Wakey
wakey!"

"What, I'm up," grumbled the pillow.

"You don't sound like you're *up* up, silly!" sang the phone. "Come on, Fletch,
I want to check out that new cafe on Fifth!"

"All right, all right," the blanket groaned, "I'll meet you at the station."

"Okie dokie! See you there!" *Beep!*

James Fletcher threw the covers to one side and swung out over the bed, blinking
at the pale orange silhouette of bars on his wall. With a sigh, he shuffled over
to the closet and pulled open the doors. A small strip of lights weakly lit the
rack of simple shirts and pullovers, the hanging organizer of jeans, and the
assorted boxes lining the floor. A dark blue hooded sweater, a shirt picked at
random, and a pair of pants later, James closed the closet doors, and rubbed his
chin in the mirror. A scraggly brown beard had been struggling to grow for
weeks, despite growing much faster just a couple of years earlier. He adjusted
his glasses and tucked his hair into the sweater, pulling the hood up over his
head.

With a labored sigh, James Fletcher set out for another day's commute.

* * *

"So Joycey tells me she heard it runs in families and she's hoping to shift
next. My doctor told me they don't actually know but hey can you imagine? We
could be a whole group of kitties!"

James winced slightly at the squeal coming from his cat-form girlfriend, her
cherry red hair bouncing with excitement as they walked.

"That would be great, Trace," he said. "Wouldn't it be safer if Joyce
didn't turn furry, though?"

Trace frowned for a moment. "She really wants to, though. Maybe if they figure
out what starts it they could make her!"

"Just as long as it doesn't happen to me," James muttered.

"Are you jeaaalous?" Trace teased. James didn't say anything as the bus rolled
up to the stop. "Oh my god you aaare!"

"No I'm not jealous," he snapped, swiping a card on the fare pad, "I just don't
want to get caught up in all that while I'm still paying for school. Speaking of
which, what did I miss yesterday?"

They found a seat in the middle of the bus, with a good view all around. While
Trace chattered away about pointers and data structures, James absently observed
his fellow riders. The commute had become stranger ever since Union Aerospace
announced they'd accidentally released a furry plague. Here was a man in a sharp
suit with black fuzzy dog ears and a nose halfway to a muzzle. There in the
back, a couple growing antlers, trying to cuddle without poking out the other's
eye. Last week, he'd even seen a dragon, standing awkwardly to avoid hitting
anyone with her folded wings.

But today, James was fairly sure his girlfriend was the only full anthro on the
bus. Just four feet tall, with golden yellow fur, and an outrageously bushy tail
nearly as long as she was tall, Trace hadn't lost an ounce of her bubbly
personality. Such bright intensity was something James had trouble imagining.
The world often felt as gray as the autumn skies, as stifling as the cell bars
cast by his sunny window blinds. He *was* envious of his girlfriend the cat,
even if he couldn't quite say why.

Trace paused her monologue to stare at him, her eyes suddenly wider than normal.
He didn't notice, whatever it was, and she suppressed her excited gasp as best
as she could, resuming her summary of the day's classes.

* * *

James stretched over the park bench with a groan, the tedium of a school day
behind him. Trace and her still-human sister Joyce were giggling about
something, while a pale red tiger took up the seat next to him. Zack Tsarni had
been the first of their ancient circle of friends to shift, way back when news
of the Outbreak was still fresh. He and Joyce Lun started dating not too long
after, Joyce's penchant for all things furry smoothing the social blowback.

"Hey man, long day?" asked Zack, curling his tail into his lap.

"Too long. I don't want to see an asterisk ever again." James clapped his hands
over his face, rubbing deeply, itching at his chin. "Usually I can just sleep
through and pick it up by osmosis but it was, like, loud in there today. How
goes the drawing?"

Zack pulled out a sketchpad, flipping to a half-finished portrait of Joyce.

"Still good. Lucked out with these paws, huh?" He twirled a pencil through his
furred fingers with ease. "I bet you wouldn't have any trouble with a keyboard."

James grimaced. "Not me, you and Trace can have it. The last thing I need
is to lose class days to those furry doctors."

"Dude," Zack frowned, "you miss half the days anyway. At least you'd be *doing*
something with them." He shrugged and turned toward the two girls now chasing
each other in the open field, pencil softly grazing the paper. James sighed and
leaned backward over the bench.

Doing something with his days off meant streaming video games to a small
audience, he thought, not turning into one of the anthros. It was bad enough
every time he escorted Trace to one of the Softpaws clinics. Visions of the
bombing at the Minneapolis branch were seared into his memory. Sure, Union
Aerospace had stepped up security for their spun-off anthro charity, but that
didn't stop the crowds of rabid protesters.

"Hey," Zack's voice interrupted his train of thought, "are you feeling okay?
You're looking pale as hell." Something was itching at James' ears. He reached
up a hand to scratch them, then stopped cold. Human ears weren't supposed to be
fuzzy.

A terrified curse slipped out of James' mouth as he fumbled for his phone's
front camera. Zack folded his sketchpad shut and waved for the girls to hurry
over. James stabbed at the camera controls to get it to flip, and finally got a
look at what he'd felt. The tips of his ears had grown a point, and were coated
in what looked to be the finest conceivable coat of white hairs, with a tinge of
green around the rim. No, not hairs, he thought. *Fur*.

In that moment, he wished for nothing more than to not have to witness the
tremendous smile spreading across his girlfriend's face.

* * *

The rest of the week stubbornly proved to not be a dream. By the next morning,
James' ears had stretched out and filled with velvety white fur, a clean band of
green on the outer edge. The morning after that, he'd itched at a fresh blot of
white poking out of his arm. The new ears were sensitive, and no longer fit his
headphones, robbing him of one way of tuning out the day. On the third day,
another patch of fur had cropped up on the other arm, and spread from shoulder
to elbow.

There was no denying it any longer, no wishing for it to go away. The anthropic
shift had found its way to James Fletcher at last, and that could only mean one
thing. He would soon have to join Trace at the...

"Clinic!" she shouted, grinning ear to ear. "I gotta get my meds today and now
you can come *in* with me! I'm so excited!"

James rubbed an ear, turning it right side out. "I couldn't tell. There's no
stopping it is there?" He leaned over the curb looking for their ride.

Trace stopped vibrating. "Why would you want it to stop? It's so you!"

He didn't have an answer. Not then, not on the bus a few minutes later. His
hoodie never left the top of his head now, but anyone could see the telltale
perk of anthro ears growing underneath. Despite his deep reservations about the
process, he couldn't honestly say he actually wanted it to stop. A persistent
little thought had cropped up, curious about what he was turning into. After
classes, he joined Trace on their usual route through downtown Savannah to the
Softpaws clinic, shoulders hunched, trying desperately to ignore the soft
feelings of his upper arms against the fabric. His ears were painfully stiff
under the hood, on high alert for dangerous passersby. Trace, naturally, was
skipping ahead letting her tail sweep a wide arc behind her. 

They had arrived at the clinic. An unassuming storefront tucked at the base of a
skyscraper, a simple lit sign overhead announcing its presence: Softpaws. Behind
a window hung the unofficially official symbol of the anthros, a hand encircling
a pawprint. An assortment of rainbow flags lined the door for good measure.
James glanced at the sky in thanks for the lack of shouting protesters on the
street. Inside, a pleasantly lit waiting room, with a handful of people in
varying stages of shift, a UAC Security guard, and the smiling receptionist
Trace was now bouncing towards.

"Welcome back, Trace," he said, scrolling a tablet behind the counter. "How have
you been feeling?"

"Oooh loving every day!" she replied, standing on tiptoes to see over the ledge.

"Just the pickup today?"

"Well, actually," Trace started, "we need to see the doc! My boyfriend here just
started transforming this week!" James sheepishly raised his hand, noticing the
tuft of white starting to peek out from the sleeve.

"Ah! Well, in that case." The man tapped a keyboard for a few seconds. "Miss
Lun, if you could wait just a moment while I check Mister, ah--"

"Fletcher."

"--Mister Fletcher in. It shouldn't take long." Trace skipped to a chair and
burst into a yellow ball of fluff, her tail splayed out over the back.

* * *

"James?" An orderly stepped out from behind a door armed with a clipboard.

"That's you, Fletchy!" Trace chirped. "Good luck!"

James shuffled to his feet, hands firmly in his pockets, and followed the lady
through the door. Why are hospitals always built like mazes, he wondered. One
corner, then two, then a sudden stop at a scale and a height laser. He glanced
at the clipboard as the orderly took notes, heart skipping a beat as she wrote
his height down. Five foot nine. As far as he knew, he'd been five eleven since
middle school.

One more corner, then finally an exam room. "Right in here, sir. Could you take
off your hoodie for me, please?" He undid the zipper front, then shrugged out,
getting a good look for the first time that day. His right arm was covered in
silky white fur down to the wrist, where some of it had formed a jagged pattern
of green matching his ears. His left arm was halfway there. His ears twitched,
happy to be free from the hood. It felt better. The orderly jotted down a few
more notes.

"Are there any other changes you've noticed?" she asked gently.

"N-no. Just this. My girlfriend says it started on Monday with my ears."

"Okay, then. You can relax in here for now. Doctor Sepulveda will be with you in
a couple minutes." And with that, she left, closing the door behind her.

*Fur*, he thought. This is *my fur* growing. James ran his left hand along the
sleeve of white covering his arm. A spark pinged away somewhere in his mind, a
long repressed desire for this kind of softness. No, not *this* specific
feeling, he corrected himself, *any* softness like this. Something about this
was touching him on a nerve deeper than he'd imagined. He stroked the fur back
and forth, lost in the shimmer glancing off the brilliant white. He didn't even
notice the doctor open the door.

"Hoo-ee," came a whistle, "that's the purest shade I've seen yet. And boy, I've
seen at least a dozen fuzzies in your color this year." A thick spotted paw
wandered into James' vision, breaking his trance. He reached out to shake it,
glancing up to see a tall lion anthro in a classic lab coat beaming at him,
orange mane bursting from all sides. "Doctor Felix Sepulveda, at your service,
son. Most people just call me Doc. And you must be James."

They shook hands. Next to a mitt that big, James thought his fingers were
looking rather slender. The lion took a rolling stool from under a table and sat
down, pulling out a tablet and stylus.

"So Miss Lun out there tells me you've been shifting for a few days now. Any
trouble?"

"No. I mean, not really." This isn't a good time, James thought. "I wasn't
ready for this to happen." That's not what I was going to say.

"Heh, no one is. Thankfully, it shouldn't take too long before you're finished
-- most people are done under a month. We're going to run a blood panel and get
a sample of your coat, see what kind of fuzzie you are. Judging by how far you
are in a week, I'd say you'll be done in another week or two, tops."

James caught himself retreating into his shoulders. "Will it hurt?"

Dr. Sepulveda sighed, his smile still in place. "There's a chance. Depends what
you're turning into. Once we pin down your species we can prescribe something to
help smooth the transformation. No doubt you've noticed your girlfriend's tail
is still growing." He chuckled gently, a deep, yet comforting boom. "All my
patients so far have said it never *hurt*, but there's plenty of discomfort to
going around. You've probably been itching a lot this week, can you imagine how
much it sucked to grow *this*?" He shook his head a couple times, his mane
waving all over, earning a small laugh from James. "But like I said, anthropic
shift gets in and gets done before you know it."

* * *

For the next several minutes, James answered a long, yet boringly standard, list
of medical questions. Did he smoke, did he drink, was he in any pain at that
moment? Did he sleep with any anthros lately?

"You don't mean..."

"No, no, it's not transmitted that way, " Dr. Sepulveda replied. "Or at least,
we're fairly sure it's not. We don't really know what kicks it off or how it
decides what to make you into, but we do like to gather some data just in case.
If it makes you feel better, I think the statistic so far is maybe a few percent
answer yes to that."

Had anyone else in his family shifted? Had any of his friends shifted? When? And
lastly, how was he feeling about it all? James paused, trying to sort his
thoughts. He *wanted* to say he was worried, scared, praying that he would get
to finish school before a humanist mob found him and his friends. But his
subconscious was saying otherwise.

"I'm.. conflicted," he finally managed to answer. "It's scary as hell but at
the same time it feels.. it feels..."

"Feels right, doesn't it?" Dr. Sepulveda offered.

"Like some part of me is all for it and taking me for the ride, yeah." James
stared down at his fingers, locking and unlocking them, marveling how small they
seemed to look, making sure to get one more touch of the fur on his wrist each
time.

Dr. Sepulveda stretched with a roar quieter than James thought possible.
"Everyone says the same thing. Maybe the shift picks us because it knows we'll
be happier somehow. I haven't met a fuzzie yet who isn't. Lift up your arm for
me, son."

The lion reached towards James' armpit with a small pair of scissors with
oversized handles, clipping a tuft of fur from the arm where no one would see it
missing. Then came a vial attached to what looked like a needle surrounded by a
thick sponge. "Don't want to stain that gorgeous coat of yours." James turned
his head away while the doctor filled one, two, three vials of blood.

"All done! Try not to touch that area for a couple hours, the sealant should
take care of it quickly. Sorry to say, but we're a bit backlogged since Miami
went dark. Lot of samples to process from down there. Normally I like to have
results right away, but I'm afraid I might not get to you for a few days. Would
you mind coming in next Friday, and we'll see where you're at?"

James nodded. They shook hands again, and he received a warm hug from the
doctor. "Welcome to the club, son. You're gonna love it."

* * *

Trace spent the weekend with James, gushing in the background of his camera
feed, fielding questions from the stream's viewers about her boyfriend's sudden
growth of fur. Some comments weren't very kind, viewers angered that James was
turning into one of *them*. Most were nicer, complimenting the coat of white
that had finished growing down to his other wrist. Some, even, thanked him for
being a presence online, a sign that they weren't alone in their own shifts.

By Monday morning, the fur had found its way partly down James' chest and back.
His fingernails were developing a black ombre from the base, hardening more than
usual. The remnants of his attempted beard were completely gone, a pale white
tint taking its place under the skin, heralding the fur to come. Trace refused
to let him skip any more classes, dragging him out of bed to start the new week.

She refused to let him hide in a hooded sweater, too. As much as he wanted to
avoid being seen in his partially-shifted state, he couldn't object to not
squashing his ears under a hood. They felt so much better in open air. Besides,
he finally reasoned, if anyone should start trouble, they would have four feet
of raw yellow energy to deal with.

Good thing, too. He could have sworn he'd dropped another inch.

The next day, he received a fright from his mirror, bright bluish-green streaks
overtaking his natural brown hair. The hair was getting a little longer, too,
reaching his shoulders. The backs of his hands had gone pale, the tips of his
fingers feeling slightly more grippy than before. Zack had been right, there
wasn't any issue typing at a keyboard as quickly as ever. As they took their
customary break at the park, James couldn't help but enjoy the feeling of wind
through his fur, an impossibly soft caress from the first October chills. The
smell of autumn was more pronounced, too, when Trace pointed out the leathery
texture his nose had taken on. Everyone had a scent, James discovered that
evening. Joyce smelled, well, human. Zack had a musty, earthy sort of smell.
Trace, he couldn't describe, but it was wonderful. And himself? Not earthy. Not
human. Was it just the time he spent with Trace that made him think his scent
was similar? That it was correct that way?

Crossed wiring, he decided, his apprehensions about the process continuing to
melt away. He was just getting used to new senses, that was all.

* * *

As Wednesday rolled around, the air took on a cold bite, the sun's streaks
becoming more pale through the open window blinds. No more bars on the wall.
James spent a few extra minutes taking in the night's additional changes. Fur
was making its way to his legs, while the backs of his hands had grown a
delicate coat to match that luxurious white. His fingernails had gone completely
black, shunted to the tips to become miniature claws. His face had turned white,
too, with a wet black nose just starting to inch its way forward. Not a trace of
brown remained in his new bright blue hair, silky soft like the rest of his fur.
James hadn't heard from Dr. Sepulveda yet, and didn't want to guess too much at
the species he'd fallen into. His back had been itching more as the days went
on, and he suspected his spine was making preparations to give him a tail. A
tail of this fur, he wondered, *my fur*. The image overtook his senses for a
moment. Something long and fluffy, and so unbelievably soft. Something he had
never been allowed to have. Why did that feel so *right*?

The feeling distracted him for most of the day. Before he knew it, Zack Tsarni
was approaching the usual park bench with a tray of tacos and drinks. No one in
the group had turned herbivore, thankfully. Joyce and Zack took up the bench,
while Trace laid out a blanket on the ground for herself and James.

"So," Joyce said between bites, "Trace won't tell me what you're turning into.
Are you a kitty too?"

"I don't think so," James replied, savoring the flavor with new taste buds. "Her
doc said he would get back to me this week."

"Hopefully he can hook you up with some good shampoo," said Zack, wiping some
sauce from his chin fur. "Unless you're getting some bleach cells to go with
that."

They all shared a laugh. A particle of taco meat decided to take that
opportunity to jump down James' throat. He coughed a couple times.

"You okay?" Trace leaned over.

"Wrong.. pipe.." Another cough. "I'll get it." Another. And then. Cough! *Yip!*

The others blinked. Trace's eyes went wide, that awful smile creeping up her
cheeks again.

"I got it, what are you all looking--" James froze. His throat felt unusually
tight, like it too had secretly shrunk with his height. And the voice coming out
was higher pitched. "Trace, don't give me that look."

She gave him that look. "*Oh my god is that real?!*" she squealed. Zack and
Joyce shared a concerned glance.

Focus. Just breathe and talk normally. "No, it's just--" He stopped again while
Trace pounced him with a hug. What was wrong with his voice? No, corrected the
spark from the back of his mind, what is *wrong* with that voice? Didn't it
make sense? Zack's fur wasn't remotely this soft, in fact it was rather coarse.
So was the lion doctor's.

A tiny whimper escaped his new throat as a tingling sensation around his nose
announced a muzzle would be coming in next.

* * *

Trace couldn't convince James to go to class the next morning. Instead, he idled
the day away trying to get lost in his games, trying to avoid hearing the newest
change. The muzzle had grown in overnight, taking up new space for his
unconscious brain to ignore in the middle of his vision. Fur had reached halfway
down his calves, and there was a definite bump starting to form at the base of
his spine, making it uncomfortable to sit at the desk for too long. That sweeter
scent, the one he had associated with Trace, was only getting stronger. Worse
still, his ears couldn't tune out to the fact that every sound he made was
brighter, gentler, a higher register than he should have had.

He desperately tried to ignore the way the fur on his chest was feeling a little
too sensitive.

Through it all, that spark of memory that had wandered through his subconscious
all week kept asking a very difficult question. What was *wrong*? The simple
conclusion to these new changes felt like something he wasn't allowed to say,
and yet still James could not honestly tell himself he didn't want them. That
sensation of his body marching towards a more *fitting* form followed the spark
around, wondering what could come next to wash away some more of his fears.
Wondering when he would finally face a question that had percolated quietly
since the clinic.

The sun streaming through the bedroom window was brighter, again, playing off
of his fur. He stretched, ignoring the soft moan he didn't mean to make. A lock
of blue hair draped into view, and he tucked it behind his fuzzy ear, shivering
at the texture of the hair and fur against the pads still growing onto his
fingers. He could hear the birds outside, singing about the end of the season,
the mild winter to come. A cheerful jingle rang out from somewhere on his bed,
and ended before he could untangle the phone from a blanket. He tapped at the
screen, thankful the fingerpads were still compatible, and opened the voicemail.

"Hey, it's Doc Felix. This is a call for James Fletcher. We've got your lab
results back, and there's a couple things I'd like to go over with you. If you
could stop by as soon as you're able, that would be terrific. Take care!"

I *bet* there's something to go over, thought James as he buried himself in a
pillow.

* * *

"You can relax in here, honey, Doctor Sepulveda will be along in a moment."

James clung to Trace's paw as they took a seat in the exam room later that
night, his hands trembling. A war was taking place in his head, between the
desire to stay the way he was before the shift started, and that persistent,
calming feeling of wanting and accepting the change. He couldn't tell who was
winning, although the lack of a known cure seemed to make accepting the shift
the better outcome. Trace simply stared, the wide ever-excited eyes paired with
a determined, loving smile. She gave him a gentle peck on the nose.

The door opened. Dr. Sepulveda walked in, tablet in hand, followed by a short
brown rabbit with ears at least to her waist. She took up a stool in the corner
of the room, looking down at a tablet of her own.

"Don't mind her, she's with the home office," the great lion said. The bunny
gave a polite bow. "Now, we have the results of the test last week, and I gotta
admit I'm kicking myself a little for not being able to give you a heads-up
sooner." James didn't say anything. "So I have some good news and some -- well,
honestly still good news."

James braced his shoulders. "G-good news first."

"Based on the fur sample, looks like you're well on your way to becoming a
perfectly healthy arctic fox. Wouldn't be *my* first choice for someone living
in the South, but there you have it. Our estimate says the payload has another
eight or nine days to finish, but given how far along you look, I'd say it could
be as low as six."

"And the--" Deep breath. "And the other good news?"

"I think you may have figured it out, my dear." Dr. Sepulveda reached out a paw,
taking James' other hand. It looked so small now in comparison, delicate.
*Feminine*. The lion easily covered it with his other paw. "It's not often, but
we have seen cases where the anthropic shift doesn't just make you a fuzzie.
Usually, those patients were already in some sort of hormonal transition when
the payload chose them. In your case, maybe something else did it. Hell, I
don't think we'll ever figure out just how this thing works." He turned James'
hand over, causing the new wolf to choke up a little. "But it always works. I
stand by what I said, sweetheart. I haven't met a fuzzie yet who wasn't happier
afterwards."

Trace had resumed her usual vibrations. "So you mean he's-- she's--" She frowned
for stumbling over her words. "You mean Fletchy's not just my wolfy *boy*friend
anymore?"

"I think that's for your friend to decide," came a quiet voice from the corner.
The rabbit was staring at the three. Intensely, but kindly.

"Which," Dr. Sepulveda started, releasing James' hand, "is why we called her
in."
