The late September sun streaked through the window blinds, throwing thin bands
of shadow onto the bedroom wall. Birds filled the air with competing calls,
while a gentle fog blanketed the ground. Autumn was approaching the Georgia
countryside, bringing a chill to the morning air. A passing deer stopped to perk
its ears, then sprinted off into a forest at a loud noise coming from the house.

An arm darted out from under the covers, flailing around for the screaming alarm
clock on the table. The peaceful silence didn't last long. On the other table, a
phone started dancing loudly across the wood. A second arm pounced on the noisy
rectangle, bringing it up to a pillow with a muffled hello.

<!--more-->

"Hellooooo!" came a voice from the other end. No response. "Fletchy! Wakey
wakey!"

"What, I'm up," grumbled the pillow.

"You don't sound like you're *up* up, silly!" sang the phone. "Come on, Fletch,
I want to check out that new cafe on Fifth!"

"All right, all right," the blanket groaned, "I'll meet you at the station."

"Okie dokie! See you there!" *Beep!*

James Fletcher threw the covers to one side and swung out over the bed, blinking
at the pale orange silhouette of bars on his wall. With a sigh, he shuffled over
to the closet and pulled open the doors. A small strip of lights weakly lit the
rack of simple shirts and pullovers, the hanging organizer of jeans, and the
assorted boxes lining the floor. A dark blue hooded sweater, a shirt picked at
random, and a pair of pants later, James closed the closet doors, and rubbed his
chin in the mirror. A scraggly brown beard had been struggling to grow for
weeks, despite growing much faster just a couple of years earlier. He adjusted
his glasses and tucked his hair into the sweater, pulling the hood up over his
head.

With a labored sigh, James Fletcher set out for another day's commute.

* * *

"So Joycey tells me she heard it runs in families and she's hoping to shift
next. My doctor told me they don't actually know but hey can you imagine? We
could be a whole group of kitties!"

James winced slightly at the squeal coming from his cat-form girlfriend, her
cherry red hair bouncing with excitement as they walked.

"That would be great, Trace," he said. "Wouldn't it be safer if Joyce
didn't turn furry, though?"

Trace frowned for a moment. "She really wants to, though. Maybe if they figure
out what starts it they could make her!"

"Just as long as it doesn't happen to me," James muttered.

"Are you jeaaalous?" Trace teased. James didn't say anything as the bus rolled
up to the stop. "Oh my god you aaare!"

"No I'm not jealous," he snapped, swiping a card on the fare pad, "I just don't
want to get caught up in all that while I'm still paying for school. Speaking of
which, what did I miss yesterday?"

They found a seat in the middle of the bus, with a good view all around. While
Trace chattered away about pointers and data structures, James absently observed
his fellow riders. The commute had become stranger ever since Union Aerospace
announced they'd accidentally released a furry plague. Here was a man in a sharp
suit with black fuzzy dog ears and a nose halfway to a muzzle. There in the
back, a couple growing antlers, trying to cuddle without poking out the other's
eye. Last week, he'd even seen a dragon, standing awkwardly to avoid hitting
anyone with her folded wings.

But today, James was fairly sure his girlfriend was the only full anthro on the
bus. Just four feet tall, with golden yellow fur, and an outrageously bushy tail
nearly as long as she was tall, Trace hadn't lost an ounce of her bubbly
personality. Such bright intensity was something James had trouble imagining.
The world often felt as gray as the autumn skies, as stifling as the cell bars
cast by his sunny window blinds. He *was* envious of his girlfriend the cat,
even if he couldn't quite say why.

Trace paused her monologue to stare at him, her eyes suddenly wider than normal.
He didn't notice, whatever it was, and she suppressed her excited gasp as best
as she could, resuming her summary of the day's classes.

* * *

James stretched over the park bench with a groan, the tedium of a school day
behind him. Trace and her still-human sister Joyce were giggling about
something, while a pale red tiger took up the seat next to him. Zack Tsarni had
been the first of their ancient circle of friends to shift, way back when news
of the Outbreak was still fresh. He and Joyce Lun started dating not too long
after, Joyce's penchant for all things furry smoothing the social blowback.

"Hey man, long day?" asked Zack, curling his tail into his lap.

"Too long. I don't want to see an asterisk ever again." James clapped his hands
over his face, rubbing deeply, itching at his chin. "Usually I can just sleep
through and pick it up by osmosis but it was, like, loud in there today. How
goes the drawing?"

Zack pulled out a sketchpad, flipping to a half-finished portrait of Joyce.

"Still good. Lucked out with these paws, huh?" He twirled a pencil through his
furred fingers with ease. "I bet you wouldn't have any trouble with a keyboard."

James grimaced. "Not me, you and Trace can have it. The last thing I need
is to lose class days to those furry doctors."

"Dude," Zack frowned, "you miss half the days anyway. At least you'd be *doing*
something with them." He shrugged and turned toward the two girls now chasing
each other in the open field, pencil softly grazing the paper. James sighed and
leaned backward over the bench.

Doing something with his days off meant streaming video games to a small
audience, he thought, not turning into one of the anthros. It was bad enough
every time he escorted Trace to one of the Softpaws clinics. Visions of the
bombing at the Minneapolis branch were seared into his memory. Sure, Union
Aerospace had stepped up security for their spun-off anthro charity, but that
didn't stop the crowds of rabid protesters.

"Hey," Zack's voice interrupted his train of thought, "are you feeling okay?
You're looking pale as hell." Something was itching at James' ears. He reached
up a hand to scratch them, then stopped cold. Human ears weren't supposed to be
fuzzy.

A terrified curse slipped out of James' mouth as he fumbled for his phone's
front camera. Zack folded his sketchpad shut and waved for the girls to hurry
over. James stabbed at the camera controls to get it to flip, and finally got a
look at what he'd felt. The tips of his ears had grown a point, and were coated
in what looked to be the finest conceivable coat of white hairs, with a tinge of
green around the rim. No, not hairs, he thought. *Fur*.

In that moment, he wished for nothing more than to not have to witness the
tremendous smile spreading across his girlfriend's face.

* * *

The rest of the week stubbornly proved to not be a dream. By the next morning,
James' ears had stretched out and filled with velvety white fur, a clean band of
green on the outer edge. The morning after that, he'd itched at a fresh blot of
white poking out of his arm. The new ears were sensitive, and no longer fit his
headphones, robbing him of one way of tuning out the day. On the third day,
another patch of fur had cropped up on the other arm, and spread from shoulder
to elbow.

There was no denying it any longer, no wishing for it to go away. The anthropic
shift had found its way to James Fletcher at last, and that could only mean one
thing. He would soon have to join Trace at the...

"Clinic!" she shouted, grinning ear to ear. "I gotta get my meds today and now
you can come *in* with me! I'm so excited!"

James rubbed an ear, turning it right side out. "I couldn't tell. There's no
stopping it is there?" He leaned over the curb looking for their ride.

Trace stopped vibrating. "Why would you want it to stop? It's so you!"

He didn't have an answer. Not then, not on the bus a few minutes later. His
hoodie never left the top of his head now, but anyone could see the telltale
perk of anthro ears growing underneath. Despite his deep reservations about the
process, he couldn't honestly say he actually wanted it to stop. A persistent
little thought had cropped up, curious about what he was turning into. After
classes, he joined Trace on their usual route through downtown Savannah to the
Softpaws clinic, shoulders hunched, trying desperately to ignore the soft
feelings of his upper arms against the fabric. His ears were painfully stiff
under the hood, on high alert for dangerous passersby. Trace, naturally, was
skipping ahead letting her tail sweep a wide arc behind her. 

They had arrived at the clinic. An unassuming storefront tucked at the base of a
skyscraper, a simple lit sign overhead announcing its presence: Softpaws. Behind
a window hung the unofficially official symbol of the anthros, a hand encircling
a pawprint. An assortment of rainbow flags lined the door for good measure.
James glanced at the sky in thanks for the lack of shouting protesters on the
street. Inside, a pleasantly lit waiting room, with a handful of people in
varying stages of shift, a UAC Security guard, and the smiling receptionist
Trace was now bouncing towards.

"Welcome back, Trace," he said, scrolling a tablet behind the counter. "How have
you been feeling?"

"Oooh loving every day!" she replied, standing on tiptoes to see over the ledge.

"Just the pickup today?"

"Well, actually," Trace started, "we need to see the doc! My boyfriend here just
started transforming this week!" James sheepishly raised his hand, noticing the
tuft of white starting to peek out from the sleeve.

"Ah! Well, in that case." The man tapped a keyboard for a few seconds. "Miss
Lun, if you could wait just a moment while I check Mister, ah--"

"Fletcher."

"--Mister Fletcher in. It shouldn't take long." Trace skipped to a chair and
burst into a yellow ball of fluff, her tail splayed out over the back.

* * *

"James?" An orderly stepped out from behind a door armed with a clipboard.

"That's you, Fletchy!" Trace chirped. "Good luck!"

James shuffled to his feet, hands firmly in his pockets, and followed the lady
through the door. Why are hospitals always built like mazes, he wondered. One
corner, then two, then a sudden stop at a scale and a height laser. He glanced
at the clipboard as the orderly took notes, heart skipping a beat as she wrote
his height down. Five foot nine. As far as he knew, he'd been five eleven since
middle school.

One more corner, then finally an exam room. "Right in here, sir. Could you take
off your hoodie for me, please?" He undid the zipper front, then shrugged out,
getting a good look for the first time that day. His right arm was covered in
silky white fur down to the wrist, where some of it had formed a jagged pattern
of green matching his ears. His left arm was halfway there. His ears twitched,
happy to be free from the hood. It felt better. The orderly jotted down a few
more notes.

"Are there any other changes you've noticed?" she asked gently.

"N-no. Just this. My girlfriend says it started on Monday with my ears."

"Okay, then. You can relax in here for now. Doctor Sepulveda will be with you in
a couple minutes." And with that, she left, closing the door behind her.

*Fur*, he thought. This is *my fur* growing. James ran his left hand along the
sleeve of white covering his arm. A spark pinged away somewhere in his mind, a
long repressed desire for this kind of softness. No, not *this* specific
feeling, he corrected himself, *any* softness like this. Something about this
was touching him on a nerve deeper than he'd imagined. He stroked the fur back
and forth, lost in the shimmer glancing off the brilliant white. He didn't even
notice the doctor open the door.

"Hoo-ee," came a whistle, "that's the purest shade I've seen yet. And boy, I've
seen at least a dozen fuzzies in your color this year." A thick spotted paw
wandered into James' vision, breaking his trance. He reached out to shake it,
glancing up to see a tall lion anthro in a classic lab coat beaming at him,
orange mane bursting from all sides. "Doctor Felix Sepulveda, at your service,
son. Most people just call me Doc. And you must be James."

They shook hands. Next to a mitt that big, James thought his fingers were
looking rather slender. The lion took a rolling stool from under a table and sat
down, pulling out a tablet and stylus.

"So Miss Lun out there tells me you've been shifting for a few days now. Any
trouble?"

"No. I mean, not really." This isn't a good time, James thought. "I wasn't
ready for this to happen." That's not what I was going to say.

"Heh, no one is. Thankfully, it shouldn't take too long before you're finished
-- most people are done under a month. We're going to run a blood panel and get
a sample of your coat, see what kind of fuzzie you are. Judging by how far you
are in a week, I'd say you'll be done in another week or two, tops."

James caught himself retreating into his shoulders. "Will it hurt?"

Dr. Sepulveda sighed, his smile still in place. "There's a chance. Depends what
you're turning into. Once we pin down your species we can prescribe something to
help smooth the transformation. No doubt you've noticed your girlfriend's tail
is still growing." He chuckled gently, a deep, yet comforting boom. "All my
patients so far have said it never *hurt*, but there's plenty of discomfort to
going around. You've probably been itching a lot this week, can you imagine how
much it sucked to grow *this*?" He shook his head a couple times, his mane
waving all over, earning a small laugh from James. "But like I said, anthropic
shift gets in and gets done before you know it."

* * *

For the next several minutes, James answered a long, yet boringly standard, list
of medical questions. Did he smoke, did he drink, was he in any pain at that
moment? Did he sleep with any anthros lately?

"You don't mean..."

"No, no, it's not transmitted that way, " Dr. Sepulveda replied. "Or at least,
we're fairly sure it's not. We don't really know what kicks it off or how it
decides what to make you into, but we do like to gather some data just in case.
If it makes you feel better, I think the statistic so far is maybe a few percent
answer yes to that."

Had anyone else in his family shifted? Had any of his friends shifted? When? And
lastly, how was he feeling about it all? James paused, trying to sort his
thoughts. He *wanted* to say he was worried, scared, praying that he would get
to finish school before a humanist mob found him and his friends. But his
subconscious was saying otherwise.

"I'm.. conflicted," he finally managed to answer. "It's scary as hell but at
the same time it feels.. it feels..."

"Feels right, doesn't it?" Dr. Sepulveda offered.

"Like some part of me is all for it and taking me for the ride, yeah." James
stared down at his fingers, locking and unlocking them, marveling how small they
seemed to look, making sure to get one more touch of the fur on his wrist each
time.

Dr. Sepulveda stretched with a roar quieter than James thought possible.
"Everyone says the same thing. Maybe the shift picks us because it knows we'll
be happier somehow. I haven't met a fuzzie yet who isn't. Lift up your arm for
me, son."

The lion reached towards James' armpit with a small pair of scissors with
oversized handles, clipping a tuft of fur from the arm where no one would see it
missing. Then came a vial attached to what looked like a needle surrounded by a
thick sponge. "Don't want to stain that gorgeous coat of yours." James turned
his head away while the doctor filled one, two, three vials of blood.

"All done! Try not to touch that area for a couple hours, the sealant should
take care of it quickly. Sorry to say, but we're a bit backlogged since Miami
went dark. Lot of samples to process from down there. Normally I like to have
results right away, but I'm afraid I might not get to you for a few days. Would
you mind coming in next Friday, and we'll see where you're at?"

James nodded. They shook hands again, and he received a warm hug from the
doctor. "Welcome to the club, son. You're gonna love it."

* * *

Trace spent the weekend with James, gushing in the background of his camera
feed, fielding questions from the stream's viewers about her boyfriend's sudden
growth of fur. Some comments weren't very kind, viewers angered that James was
turning into one of *them*. Most were nicer, complimenting the coat of white
that had finished growing down to his other wrist. Some, even, thanked him for
being a presence online, a sign that they weren't alone in their own shifts.

By Monday morning, the fur had found its way partly down James' chest and back.
His fingernails were developing a black ombre from the base, hardening more than
usual. The remnants of his attempted beard were completely gone, a pale white
tint taking its place under the skin, heralding the fur to come. He realized his
glasses made the world painfully blurry, his eyes adjusting to crisp details
he'd never seen before.

Trace refused to let him skip any more classes, dragging him out of bed to start
the new week. She refused to let him hide in a hooded sweater, too. As much as
he wanted to avoid being seen in his partially-shifted state, he couldn't object
to not squashing his ears under a hood. They felt so much better in open air.
Besides, he finally reasoned, if anyone should start trouble, they would have
four feet of raw yellow energy to deal with.

Good thing, too. He could have sworn he'd dropped another inch.

The next day, he received a fright from his mirror, bright bluish-green streaks
overtaking his natural brown hair. The hair was getting a little longer, too,
reaching his shoulders. The backs of his hands had gone pale, the tips of his
fingers feeling slightly more grippy than before. Zack had been right, there
wasn't any issue typing at a keyboard as quickly as ever. As they took their
customary break at the park, James couldn't help but enjoy the feeling of wind
through his fur, an impossibly soft caress from the first October chills. The
smell of autumn was more pronounced, too, when Trace pointed out the leathery
texture his nose had taken on. Everyone had a scent, James discovered that
evening. Joyce smelled, well, human. Zack had a musty, earthy sort of smell.
Trace, he couldn't describe, but it was wonderful. And himself? Not earthy. Not
human. Was it just the time he spent with Trace that made him think his scent
was similar? That it was correct that way?

Crossed wiring, he decided, his apprehensions about the process continuing to
melt away. He was just getting used to new senses, that was all.

* * *

As Wednesday rolled around, the air took on a cold bite, the sun's streaks
becoming more pale through the open window blinds. No more bars on the wall.
James spent a few extra minutes taking in the night's additional changes. Fur
was making its way to his legs, while the backs of his hands had grown a
delicate coat to match that luxurious white. His fingernails had gone completely
black, shunted to the tips to become miniature claws. His face had turned white,
too, with a wet black nose just starting to inch its way forward. Not a trace of
brown remained in his new bright blue hair, silky soft like the rest of his fur.
James hadn't heard from Dr. Sepulveda yet, and didn't want to guess too much at
the species he'd fallen into. His back had been itching more as the days went
on, and he suspected his spine was making preparations to give him a tail. A
tail of this fur, he wondered, *my fur*. The image overtook his senses for a
moment. Something long and fluffy, and so unbelievably soft. Something he had
never been allowed to have. Why did that feel so *right*?

The feeling distracted him for most of the day. Before he knew it, Zack Tsarni
was approaching the usual park bench with a tray of tacos and drinks. No one in
the group had turned herbivore, thankfully. Joyce and Zack took up the bench,
while Trace laid out a blanket on the ground for herself and James.

"So," Joyce said between bites, "Trace won't tell me what you're turning into.
Are you a kitty too?"

"I don't think so," James replied, savoring the flavor with new taste buds. "Her
doc said he would get back to me this week."

"Hopefully he can hook you up with some good shampoo," said Zack, wiping some
sauce from his chin fur. "Unless you're getting some bleach cells to go with
that."

They all shared a laugh. A particle of taco meat decided to take that
opportunity to jump down James' throat. He coughed a couple times.

"You okay?" Trace leaned over.

"Wrong.. pipe.." Another cough. "I'll get it." Another. And then. Cough! *Yip!*

The others blinked. Trace's eyes went wide, that awful smile creeping up her
cheeks again.

"I got it, what are you all looking--" James froze. His throat felt unusually
tight, like it too had secretly shrunk with his height. And the voice coming out
was higher pitched. "Trace, don't give me that look."

She gave him that look. "*Oh my god is that real?!*" she squealed. Zack and
Joyce shared a concerned glance.

Focus. Just breathe and talk normally. "No, it's just--" He stopped again while
Trace pounced him with a hug. What was wrong with his voice? No, corrected the
spark from the back of his mind, what is *wrong* with that voice? Didn't it
make sense? Zack's fur wasn't remotely this soft, in fact it was rather coarse.
So was the lion doctor's.

A tiny whimper escaped his new throat as a tingling sensation around his nose
announced a muzzle would be coming in next.

* * *

Trace couldn't convince James to go to class the next morning. Instead, he idled
the day away trying to get lost in his games, trying to avoid hearing the newest
change. The muzzle had grown in overnight, taking up new space for his
unconscious brain to ignore in the middle of his vision. Fur had reached halfway
down his calves, and there was a definite bump starting to form at the base of
his spine, making it uncomfortable to sit at the desk for too long. That sweeter
scent, the one he had associated with Trace, was only getting stronger. Worse
still, his ears couldn't tune out to the fact that every sound he made was
brighter, gentler, a higher register than he should have had.

He desperately tried to ignore the way the fur on his chest was feeling a little
too sensitive.

Through it all, that spark of memory that had wandered through his subconscious
all week kept asking a very difficult question. What was *wrong*? The simple
conclusion to these new changes felt like something he wasn't allowed to say,
and yet still James could not honestly tell himself he didn't want them. That
sensation of his body marching towards a more *fitting* form followed the spark
around, wondering what could come next to wash away some more of his fears.
Wondering when he would finally face a question that had percolated quietly
since the clinic.

The sun streaming through the bedroom window was brighter, again, playing off
of his fur. He stretched, ignoring the soft moan he didn't mean to make. A lock
of blue hair draped into view, and he tucked it behind his fuzzy ear, shivering
at the texture of the hair and fur against the pads still growing onto his
fingers. He could hear the birds outside, singing about the end of the season,
the mild winter to come. A cheerful jingle rang out from somewhere on his bed,
and ended before he could untangle the phone from a blanket. He tapped at the
screen, thankful the fingerpads were still compatible, and opened the voicemail.

"Hey, it's Doc Felix. This is a call for James Fletcher. We've got your lab
results back, and there's a couple things I'd like to go over with you. If you
could stop by as soon as you're able, that would be terrific. Take care!"

I *bet* there's something to go over, thought James as he buried himself in a
pillow.

* * *

"You can relax in here, honey, Doctor Sepulveda will be along in a moment."

James clung to Trace's paw as they took a seat in the exam room later that
night, his hands trembling. A war was taking place in his head, between the
desire to stay the way he was before the shift started, and that persistent,
calming feeling of wanting and accepting the change. He couldn't tell who was
winning, although the lack of a known cure seemed to make accepting the shift
the better outcome. Trace simply stared, the wide ever-excited eyes paired with
a determined, loving smile. She gave him a gentle peck on the nose.

The door opened. Dr. Sepulveda walked in, tablet in hand, followed by a short
brown rabbit with ears at least to her waist. She took up a stool in the corner
of the room, looking down at a tablet of her own.

"Don't mind her, she's with the home office," the great lion said. The bunny
gave a polite bow. "Now, we have the results of the test last week, and I gotta
admit I'm kicking myself a little for not being able to give you a heads-up
sooner." James didn't say anything. "So I have some good news and some -- well,
honestly still good news."

James braced his shoulders. "G-good news first."

"Based on the fur sample, looks like you're well on your way to becoming a
perfectly healthy arctic fox. Wouldn't be *my* first choice for someone living
in the South, but there you have it. Our estimate says the payload has another
eight or nine days to finish, but given how far along you look, I'd say it could
be as low as six."

"And the--" Deep breath. "And the other good news?"

"I think you may have figured it out, my dear." Dr. Sepulveda reached out a paw,
taking James' other hand. It looked so small now in comparison, delicate.
*Feminine*. The lion easily covered it with his other paw. "It's not often, but
we have seen cases where the anthropic shift doesn't just make you a fuzzie.
Usually, those patients were already in some sort of hormonal transition when
the payload chose them. In your case, maybe something else did it. Hell, I don't
think we'll ever figure out just how this thing works." He turned James' hand
over, causing the new wolf to choke up a little. "But it always works. I stand
by what I said, dear. I haven't met a fuzzie yet who wasn't happier afterwards."

Trace had resumed her usual vibrations. "So you mean he's-- she's--" She frowned
at stumbling over her words. "You mean Fletchy's not just my wolfy *boy*friend
anymore?"

"I think that's for your friend to decide," came a quiet voice from the corner.
The rabbit was staring at them. Intensely, but kindly.

"Which," Dr. Sepulveda started, releasing James' hand, "is why we called *her*
in. This is Shizuka Valenheart." Another polite bow from the rabbit, whose eyes
were now looking more directly at James, studying. "She's a liaison from a
community called Furhaven, up in the Cascades. I called Ms. Valenheart to come
visit when I saw your species report come back. Far as I know, we can make it
just about anywhere, but an arctic wolf might be happier further from the Gulf."

"But I have to finish school, I--" James paused again. *Could* he finish school?
Faculty had gone along with the recommended accommodations for anthros, like
being more lenient during the shift since the student would clearly have more
pressing issues. But this was *Georgia*. It wasn't safe to be a... to be... the
word wouldn't come to mind. Breathe. What would his parents think? He hadn't
even called them since the shift started. Breathe. Would Trace still love him
even if he were...

* * *

"Breathe." James blinked back tears to find the bunny, Shizuka, sitting directly
in front of him, eyes level, a furry handpaw on both of his shoulders. "Come on
now, breathe. I asked Doc and Ms. Lun to step outside for a bit." She gently
rubbed his shoulders, relaxing the contorted hug he seemed to have put himself
in. "There you go, honey. Breathe." She reached a hand up to wipe tears he
didn't realize he'd been shedding. "You aren't worried about school, are you?"

"I can't--" he choked, "I can't be a--" Shizuka put a finger to his muzzle.

"Relax," she said gently, "I saw it the moment you came in tonight. Wouldn't
have even needed Doc's explanation. You're not just shifting in form, are you
honey?" All he could do was shake his head, a wilting sob forcing its way up
through his throat. "When did your voice kick in?"

"Y-Yesterday," he squeaked. Those soldiers defending his human self were making
a brave stand. The only good it did was to make him shudder again.

"And now you're torn between who you used to be and who you're turning into.
That was easier when you thought you were just turning furry, and I bet I can
guess who's starting to win." James nodded, decidedly unmanly sounds freely
issuing from his muzzle. Words weren't quite cooperating. "But, how are you
feeling about it?"

"It felt *right*," he finally managed to say, "like *not* having fur was
unnatural. And this, it.. it doesn't feel *wrong*."

"It feels just as unnatural now to fight it, doesn't it? If I had to guess, I'd
say you've been waiting for something like this for most of your life." Shizuka
stroked away a stray tear that had been rolling down his cheek. "I think your
girlfriend out there has been waiting for it, too. She was positively radiant
when Doc mentioned transitions. So let's cut to the chase." She rolled back
slightly and knocked twice on the wall. A moment later, Trace and the Doc sat
down in their chairs again. The lion closed his eyes and nodded at the golden
cat.

"So, um, what should I call you now, Fletchy?" Trace whispered.

James closed his eyes, cheeks becoming damp. A spark of memory, descending upon
that mental battlefield to light a warm flame. The tremble in his hands causing
his fur to dance, the softness lining up behind the spark. He opened his eyes
again and looked at his fellow anthros. The lion, who gave no hesitation to
validating this change. The rabbit, an angel summoned to give guidance. And the
cat, faithful and vibrant, hanging expectantly for an answer. A lock of
iridescent blue hair fell into view, glittering in the light, just like the
beautiful fur of the hand now examining it.

"Jewel," she said at last. "Let's try Jewel for now."

* * *

Friday came and went, and the new wolf remained in bed for most of the day, her
stomach turning from a combination of the previous night's revelation, and the
throbbing aches from her waist growing a tail. Trace stopped by with a bottle
from Softpaws, but despite her infectious enthusiasm, the wolf could hardly
string two words together.

A string of hazy dreams had set to the task of making sense of her feelings.
Dull objections sounded from the back of her mind, feebly resisting the change
in pronouns, but they were being lost in the warm love she found herself
embracing. It would work out, somehow, she told herself. Trace wasn't going
anywhere. Even though Zack and Joyce hadn't heard the news yet, she was sure
they would stick with her, too. And school? They were reluctantly accepting her
transformation into an anthro, if only because the distraction of the shift only
lasted a few weeks, but Georgia had barely caught up to the gay rights movement
from years ago, much less the transgender rights movement that followed. And
even then, those girls would be changing over a much longer period, not a
weekend. Maybe she wouldn't get to finish here.

It sure felt good to switch over so quickly, though. Her dreams replayed the
appointment again and again, pausing with excitement at the moment she chose her
name, sinking into it as though she'd cast a magic spell. Jewel, what her hair
had reminded her of in that instant, a gleaming gemstone playing with that pure
white fur. Jewel, so similar to James that her friends would have little trouble
changing. It fit, the same way her fur fit, the way her new tail would fit. The
same way *she* fit. Jewel burrowed deeper into her blanket, feeling every strand
of her fur settle.

"I haven't met a fuzzie yet who wasn't happier afterwards."

And she was.

* * *

Saturday dawn was interrupted by the appearance of a gray blanket on the
horizon, and a sharp wind blowing ahead. The sunrise took on a misty gray as it
lightened the bedroom. Shadows disappeared from the ground outside. Birds
retreated to their nests, chirping to pass the time.

Jewel stretched with a yawn, her back feeling like she'd slept on a lump the
whole night. As she rubbed her eyes, she turned around to see that she had.
Trace had crawled into the other side of the bed, her oversized tail now easily
longer than her body, sprawled out in the middle of the blankets. And
underneath, Jewel could see a thin ribbon of white, stiffly connected to her own
back. *Her tail*, a few feet long and covered in a thin coat of fur, poking
above her pajamas. She had a feeling it wouldn't be so thin for long, an idea
that sent a shiver down her spine. Or maybe that was the tail learning to
twitch in excitement.

She swung her legs off the bed and sat up, the base of her tail forcing her to
adjust her posture. No more slouching over, she thought. A couple blinks tricked
her brain into acknowledging the furry muzzle between her eyes, two rows of
small green spots lining the corners. Jewel ran her fingers along the length,
tickled by the sensation. Speaking of tickling, the sparkling fur had reached
her ankles, and her feet had turned pale in anticipation. On the table, Trace
had left the bottle of pills and a written letter from Dr. Sepulveda.

"You're making wonderful progress, but the easiest changes are behind you.
Expect a lot of discomfort over the next week. Your tail is starting, and I
expect it to finish by the end of the weekend. You've also begun to develop
breast tissue, and there's a good chance you should see some plumbing be
rearranged downstairs before this is over. As a wolf, your lower legs will start
shifting to a digitigrade posture any day now, which will likely be the most
painful experience. Take this prescription as needed to handle the strain, and
be sure to exercise your new joints. See me next Friday or as soon as you finish
the shift, you'll know when that is. Call this number if you have any troubles.
Good luck, Jewel! --Doc"

She put down the note and picked up the bottle, turning it over in her hands.
The pills contained a mixture of half the alphabet she couldn't make sense of,
but the instructions, "TAKE AS NEEDED FOR PAIN," were clear enough. The bottle,
too, returned to the table, as Jewel rose to her feet. Let the rest of the week
pass quickly, she thought. Get it over with.

Trace stirred on the bed behind her, turning over to grab hold of her giant
tail, and smiled up at Jewel shifting her weight on her heels. "You look silly,"
she giggled. Trace rolled closer to the edge of the bed, and gave Jewel's
nascent tail a gentle tug. Jewel yipped and spun around, conjuring the best
glare she could manage with her new facial muscles.

"That's attached to me, you know," she said, dialing for a pout rather than a
glare.

Trace giggled. "I had to make sure. I could have been growing a new color."
Jewel sat back down on the bed, while Trace propped herself up on her elbows.
"You haven't looked this happy in.. I guess since we were kids."

Jewel gave a long, deep sigh. "I haven't *felt* this good for as long as I can
remember. I know I was freaking out this week but now," she hugged herself
tight, rubbing her arms, "now it just feels *right*. Like I'm home. Did it feel
like this for you?"

"Yeah, I suppose," Trace pondered, reaching out a hand to compare their
heights, "but let's be honest I haven't really changed *that* much. You,
though," she trailed off.

They sat in silence for a moment. Jewel continued rubbing her shoulders, and
turned her head away.

"I wanted this," she finally said, "all my life I dreamed of this. I just didn't
think it could happen in my lifetime." She tried a smile and turned back around.
"Or that I would turn furry, too."

Trace hummed gently, leaning forward to pull her girlfriend into a well-deserved
hug.

* * *

Monday arrived before they realized it, having spent the weekend getting to know
each other better than ever before. Jewel's tail finished overnight, a lavishly
soft burst of light with the same banded pattern of green as on her wrists and
ankles. She couldn't resist wagging it back and forth whenever she walked. Her
feet had grown their fur, and as she tried to climb out of bed, she found her
ankles be painfully stiff. It felt easier to walk on her tiptoes after taking a
tablet from the Softpaws bottle.

And the Doc was right on the timing -- a pair of mounds had started to lift her
chest, visibly inflating even her darkest hoodie. Trace stopped home the
previous night, collecting simple outfits from the time just a month or two
before when she was Jewel's height, now a measly five foot four. She had
purchased a skirt early on that would accommodate a tail, then promptly shrunk
out of its size. Still, it fit Jewel now. There wouldn't be any concealing the
extent of her shift.

The commute passed uneventfully -- the businessman had become a rather handsome
black lab, the deer couple behind him cuddling at just the right angle to avoid
tangling their antlers. At their park bench on campus, Zack and Joyce both gave
Jewel their best hugs, with Trace having to physically pull the remaining human
off of her girlfriend. It felt strange to not be the tallest in the group
anymore.

Classes passed with less ease. Jewel and Trace were still the only two anthros
in the class learning about functions and objects and compilers, and now that
she'd undergone a gender shift as well, Jewel sensed a tense charge in the air.
Instructors gave a dark look when her soprano voice rang out during a roll call.
Her classmates, already content to pay her no mind when she was merely missing
or sleeping, now seemed to actively avoid her gaze, preferring to stare behind
her back. If not for Trace's reputation in the gym, retaining all of her former
strength packed into a more compact form, Jewel was sure something would happen
in the classroom.

Instead, she found a security guard standing outside her last class of the day.

"Sorry, you can't come in here," he barked, uniform crisp and impeccable.

"What?" Jewel stepped back in surprise. "I've been taking this class for weeks!
What do you mean I can't come in?"

"You're not on the roster, Miss..."

"Fletcher. Jewel Fle--" she blinked, "I mean, James Fletcher."

The burly man pulled out a tablet and began to scroll. "Yeah no, the James
Fletcher I've got on my list is a human male. There aren't any animals in this
class."

"I've been shifting for two weeks, *in* class!" Her instincts were telling her
to fight another day, but her conscience was still asking to stand her ground.

"I don't care if you're dressed in drag, lady. You're not on the list, you don't
come in, and that's final." He crossed his arms, sneering down from his six foot
perch. Jewel suddenly felt very vulnerable, spotting the radio near one of his
hands, and a Taser within reach of the other. She backed away slowly, before
turning around a corner and breaking into a run. She didn't stop until she
collapsed on her park bench.

The gray blanket had dominated the sky all weekend, and at last she felt a
droplet splat on her snout. Her heart was still beating a rapid tattoo,
adrenaline coursing through her veins. She suddenly became aware of the severe
cramp both ankles had developed, which only seemed to tighten the further she
got from the flight response. Jewel pawed at her pocket to retrieve her phone,
and dialed the number Dr. Sepulveda had left her.

"Softpaws Savannah, how can I direct you?" greeted a pleasant male voice.

Jewel struggled between heaving breaths. "I need.. Doc.. Spul.. Sepal.. Doc
Felix! I need help..." The phone slipped out of her shaking hand.

* * *

"How could they just leave her out there?" a voice was shouting. Female.
"*Verdammt diese Primaten*, we're not *animals*!"

"Georgia's not on board with the Anthro Affirmation Act," another voice replied,
softly. Male. "I talked with the university dean, he wasn't very polite."

Jewel opened her eyes slowly, then winced. She was sitting down, in a chair with
an open back that felt just right for a tail. Her arms held her stomach tight, a
furious burning sensation coming from a few inches further down. Her whole body
felt wet, the soft fur pinned down all over. She let out a pained moan to stop
the shouting match.

"You're safe, my dear." The familiar baritone of Dr. Sepulveda vibrated her
body. "Miss Lun and your friends carried you here after I got your call. I'm
afraid your, ah, plumber arrived a lot sooner than we thought."

Jewel looked around the room. She was seated in a larger exam room at Softpaws,
it seemed, large enough to hold herself, Dr. Sepulveda, Trace, Joyce, Zack,
Shizuka Valenheart of Furhaven, a tall vixen in a colorful dress fuming at
something out the window, and a similarly tall grey marten in a rather informal
looking suit. Her friends were seated nearby, alternating between concern for
Jewel, and sympathetic anger with the fox.

"Why.. hurt.." was about all Jewel could put together.

"I'm sorry, dear, predicting the shift is an inexact science." Dr. Sepulveda
handed Trace a towel to help dry Jewel's hair. "I told you, I've only seen a few
cases like yours, but they had fur come in last, not first."

The marten crossed the room, offering his hand. "Introductions are in order. I'm
Maarten van Holstruk, Chief Executive Officer of the Union Aerospace
Corporation." His tone was calm and level. She gave a weak handshake before
resuming her doubled-over position. "I don't get to use the full title much,
these days. Most people just call me Patient Zero."

Jewel wanted to be more enthusiastic about meeting *the* celebrity of the anthro
world, but couldn't get past the pain in her lower body. Shizuka joined the
vixen at the window.

"I'll get to it, miss. I founded Softpaws in order to better serve anthros like
yourself. Those whose home lives are made difficult by the shift. We help
support communities like theirs," he pointed a thumb over his shoulder at the
rabbit and fox, "so that there's a safe place to turn. And in your case, I think
you might be needing it."

"What do you mean?" Trace asked, gently blotting Jewel's ears.

"He means we're offering you a new home," said Shizuka, padding over to crouch
next to Trace. "Safe and well away from humans, for the most part. Room enough
for all four of you. Savannah isn't going to be safe for long, and we haven't
had luck getting to new residents before their situations did." The vixen swore
again, something dark and German.

"There are closer sanctuaries suited for an arctic fox," van Holstruk continued,
"but Ms. Valenheart here asked to rehome you to Furhaven, specifically."

Another pulse from her groin made Jewel yelp, a pained cry that turned into a
wolflike howl.

"We'll let you guys think about it," the rabbit said, resting a hand around
Jewel's cheek. "Let your friend get through *this* first, and we'll talk again
later."

* * *

A steady beep burrowed into Jewel's ears, gently rousing her from a fitful
sleep. Dr. Sepulveda had insisted she stay the night at the Softpaws clinic. She
found herself loosely dressed in a hospital gown, her tail resting around her
thighs. Rain pattered the windows, a beautiful, if dim and gray, vista of
downtown Savannah. One window was opened slightly, letting a cool breeze
circulate around the room. Trace was sound asleep in an armchair on one side,
the massive yellow shock of a tail serving as a full body pillow. On her other
side, the tall vixen reclined on a small double-wide couch, reading a paperback
in her lap. Shizuka the rabbit was snoring quietly on her shoulder, a long,
orange ear lopped around her arms.

Jewel's head felt heavy, and a dull ache resounded from every corner of her
body. Everything below her waist felt numb. She bent her knees slightly,
relieved that nothing was paralyzed, enjoying the detached feeling of her fur
rubbing on the sheets. She tried sitting up, rewarded with a wave of dizziness,
and a confused moan. The vixen looked up from her book.

"Easy, there, you've got a few hours yet," she said in a soft German accent.
"How are you feeling?" Jewel braced her hands on the bed to keep from falling
over. "Here," she added, handing the wolf a cup of water, "you probably need
some of this."

"Who are you?" Jewel asked, downing the water in one gulp.

"Hmm, you *were* out of it when they brought you in," the fox said, chuckling.
"I am Marina Hasenkamp, I tend bar." Jewel blinked, confused. "Sorry, couldn't
resist. I can't really compare to you getting to meet the king of the furries.
I'm here with the Furhaven outreach crew, mostly to keep an eye on the bunny."

Jewel frowned, looking around the room. "Where did everyone go?"

"Your friends, the tiger and his human, left with Maarten a few hours ago. Doc's
with another patient, and your girlfriend over there wouldn't leave you no
matter how sleepy she got. So Shizu and I kept watch. It is almost six in the
morning." Marina stretched, a scratchy yawn filling the air. "How are you
feeling?" she asked again.

"Sore," said Jewel, stretching herself, "like I got hit by a truck." She glanced
down, her cheeks warm. She didn't need to look to know what had happened down
there. "It almost feels like I'm--"

"Complete," Marina finished. "Like you've needed it your whole life." She turned
to look at a monitor above the bed and laughed. "Sepulveda bet too high, you're
just about done now. Your legs are the last to go."

A tingle from her ankles seemed to agree. Jewel pulled back the covers to see
her feet, fully covered in white fur. Soft black pads had formed on the base of
her toes and the ball of each foot, the arches pulled up to meet her ankles,
bent backwards. She dug through the numbness to wiggle her toes, sensing the
chain of muscles in the arches that would support her weight from now on.

"What happens now?" she wondered.

Marina stretched again. "Your friends sounded like they would be happy to go
with you however you decide. I'm sure Trace will, too. It is up to you."

Jewel hugged herself lightly, rubbing the fur on her shoulders. A new home, away
from humans who might want to hurt her. Her friends would be with her, and she
could make new friends.

"What about my classes?" she said quietly. "They kicked me out and I still have
to pay the loans. And clothes."

"We can help with that," Marina said with a smile. "We have an agreement with
Seattle U to transfer credits from anywhere, and there is a little economy that
will support us really well, including a pair of skilled tailors. There is a
railroad that brings good This year we
have been visiting these clinics looking for anthros who need a new home. And we
found you."

"But why me?" Jewel asked, calming herself with the softness of her fur.

"*Meine Karotte* senses things about people sometimes. She couldn't bear to
leave you here, even with your wonderful friends." She stroked the rabbit's ear.

"When could we leave?" asked Jewel, examining the pattern in her gown. Marina
looked up and smiled.

"Whenever you are ready," the fox smiled.

"Okay." Jewel took a deep breath, savoring the smell of rain, the tiny currents
of air tickling her fur. "Okay. Yes, I want to go."

* * *

"We get to go on a jet! This is so cool!" Joyce hadn't stopped gushing to Zack
about their travel arrangements since the group arrived at the airport. Jewel
stood hand in hand with Trace, the cat's tail curled up around her girlfriend's
waist. Shizuka and Marina were in discussion with patient zero Maarten van
Holstruk, an idea for open shelters for anthros without a home. Ahead, a human
Union Aerospace crew was busy preparing the company plane that would take them
all west. A dying rain fell on the tarmac, a waxing moon occasionally peeking
through the clouds.

They had spent the previous day packing Jewel's apartment, then Trace's when
they realized there wasn't much to pack. Zack and Joyce had decided they would
come back for their things after checking out Furhaven. The morning before their
flight, Shizuka had filled Jewel in on as many details about the village as she
could, about the great lodge most of them lived in, the fledgling medieval town
growing by the lake, the dozens of greenhouses growing exotic fruits and
vegetables normally impossible in the climate of the Cascades. Jewel felt the
last traces of worry melting away, the chance to start fresh among anthros like
herself too important to miss.

A fuel truck detached its hose from the plane's wing, while a single baggage
cart rolled up to the tail. So much coordination for such a small thing, Jewel
thought, unsure if her subconscious meant the plane or herself. Patient zero
himself, arriving at just the right time for the anthropic shift to upend her
life. Her girlfriend, shifted only a few weeks earlier. Zack Tsarni, shifted in
the early days, yet remained strong enough to stick by his friends. Joyce, who
wanted so much to transform like her sister, and hadn't yet had the chance. The
rabbit and the fox, an unlikely pair, putting their life on hold to save others.
And Jewel, adapting so gracefully to the changes that had been thrown at her.

The baggage truck pulled away, and a group of crewmen approached the terminal
where Jewel stood with her family. They ushered the anthros out onto the tarmac
under umbrellas, to a staircase perched on the side. Maarten van Holstruk
climbed first, followed by Shizuka and Marina, still chatting about their ideas.
Joyce practically skipped up the stairs, dragging an equally enthusiastic tiger
behind her.

Trace took an umbrella from the crew, leading her girlfriend up the stairs. At
the top, Jewel paused and closed her eyes, turning her head up toward the
clouds. Stray raindrops splashed off her face, a baptism for the new wolf and
her new life. The grass in the airfield flooded her snout with an intoxicating
aroma. A great smile crawled across her face, and she opened her eyes to see the
moon smiling back. Jewel howled at it, a bright flame in her heart.

At last, she turned around, and followed her anthro girlfriend into the plane.
