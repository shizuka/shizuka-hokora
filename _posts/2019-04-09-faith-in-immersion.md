Imagination is a powerful tool, when pointed in the right direction. We spend a
great deal of our lives being told to see the *correct* solution to a problem,
to turn our imaginations only to that purpose. As a result, we often find
ourselves losing the ability to simply *create*, to "let the imagination wander"
or "just write whatever comes to mind". Presented with a blank page, and the
infinite space of possibilities, we often freeze.

To find matter in such a space, to let go and observe where the heart wants to
explore, we call *immersion*. We describe a scene in such focused detail that we
can lose ourselves in the feeling. Sometimes, that scene runs off in a scary
direction, introducing features on its own that we don't want. It can be
tempting to stop there, at the first sign of resistance. Instead, if we ask the
right questions, we can gently steer it back to the feelings we want. If the
shelter is no good, is there another? If the walls can't decide what texture
they are, what if they share between two walls? The process of immersion can be
a complement to grounding, a helpful stop against anxiety spiraling out of
control. When successful, we arrive at a scene we can lose ourselves in again.

This is how one such immersive intervention went.

*Faith, if I say  "Imagine a park", what do you think of?*

A park  
Small winding concrete path  
Trees overhead  
Grass  
A playground  
A bench  
A bun on a bicycle goes by  
But I'm just telling you what I see in my head  
That's all

I can't describe to myself a place I want to see. Because to describe something
I need to already be seeing it.

I like cozy, but cozy is so abstract. There's so many different kinds of cozy,
and if I ask for cozy I always get the same place. I don't have a list of places
that are cozy.

*Maybe it's simpler to start from the visuals.*  
*And then think of one thing to hear.*  
*Is the bun ringing the bike bell, for instance?*

She is now...

*Birds in the trees?*

No, the birds sounded out of place. Too close to me.

*Wind in the leaves?*

Brrr.. cold. Wind needs to go away, or I need a jacket.

*Just a short wind then, high up, so it's only kissing the tops of the trees.*

Oh, I didn't  know they made wind like that.

*It makes a soft hushing sound, while it's calm at the ground."

No, the wind is picking up instead. Bad wind! Why are you like this?  
A merry-go-round just flew past me and knocked over a tree.  
Now it's raining hard, and I hear thunder nearby.  
I want to go home.

I want the park to go back, I want it to be a nice cozy park again. I can make
things change as long as I maintain this feeling of forcing them into place. But
as soon as I let go, they spring back to how they were.

I just want to see the things I want to see. Why is it so hard?

*Shhh... The wind is strong, but is there a shelter to go under?*

Yes. I'm under it now, but it's still cold and miserable.

*Is there a radiator nearby?*

No, it's just a little wooden roof, with a wall on one side, and nothing on the
other three.

*I think if the shelter is small and not very sheltering, we should find another one.*  
*And also make a note to file a complaint with the park board.*

I see..  
A building with windows  
And lights on the inside  
I'm going to run over to it.

*Looks warm.*

The mulch is all bleh. Why are they using woodchips in this park for the
playground? Those hurt so much when you fall.  
Oh well, here I am inside.

*Big heavy door keeps out the wind.*

It's deserted though, or it seems to be. There's a cozy couch to sit on.

*Is there a fireplace?*

No. Wait, now there is. Under the TV.

*Are there pillows on the couch?*

Yeah, with cute patterns. One has this little calico cat, with a speech bubble
that says "mew".

*They look soft and squishy. What does it smell like?*

It smells like pillow.

*Are the walls made of wood?*

I can see wood now but it's wrong. It's not supposed to be bare wood like that,
like a superposition of two wall types. Bare wood and typical painted walls, and
it can't decide which to be. It didn't look painted on the outside. Maybe it was
painted to look like bare wood. But now I can't tell it to be one or the other,
it springs back to the superposition if I do.

*Is there anything else near the couch?*

There's an ottoman off to the side. And a glass coffee table with metal legs.
No, wood legs, like a darker wood, rectangular. The couch is soft, you just fall
into it, sink in a little and then it's firm and supporting.

*Could you stretch out on it?*

Yeah.  
There's someone coming down the stairs to my right.  
They look like [Marina](/articles/2019-03/kleine-karotte).

*Is there a rug on the floor? Is it a short rug or a deep one you could lose a paw in?*

Under the coffee table, yeah. It kind of stretches out under the couch too.
Short. It's like a maroon, with some oranges and golds.

*Is there a fire in the fireplace?*

Yes. The fireplace is made of these grey bricks, with one of those sliding metal
chain link things in front of it.

*Keeps you safe. Is there anything on the table?*

Oh yeah, there's like a cup holder, with a black mug on top. I can see steam
coming off of it, I think it's tea. Yeah it's green tea, and it's nice and warm
and tasty.

*Take a deep breath.*

It smells nice. I can hear the crackle of the fire.

*Is it still raining outside?*

Yeah, I can hear it coming down on top of the chimney, echoing out through the
fireplace. It's gentler now though. I can hear it tapping on the glass and see
the droplets coalesce as they slide down the window. Marina gave me a hug.

*You looked like you needed one. Is there anyone else nearby?*

No. Well, Diana and Aurora feel mentally close. But I don't see them.

*Can you call out to them?*

I can. I can talk to them. They're just not in here weith me. I could ask them
to come in I guess.  
Oh, now Diana is sitting on the couch. And Aurora is lying on the rug next to
the coffee table. Her mane is slightly glowy. It's lighting up the area around
her with a soft blue green. Diana looks very glowy too, but she's not giving off
light to the environment, she's just very blue. More blue than she has any right
to be, given the lighting.

*I should bring down a blanket for you all.*

Yes, please do. Make sure it's soft.

*If you look down at yourself, do you see human legs?*

Yeah, but that doesn't feel right. They're bare legs.  
Oh, now I have a long soft dress on instead. I'm a wolf girl, human but with
wolf ears, and a tail, and little wolf fangs.

*What color is your tail?*

Light grey, with a white tip. Big and fluffy.

*I bet your ears match. I brought the biggest blanket I could find.*

Yay, throw it over us.

*Red and black checkered plaid, and very soft.*

I'm laying down with Diana now. Blanket is cozy.

*Snuggled under a blanket, with a warm fire, some good smelling tea, and the gentle patter of rain at the window.*

Now this is cozy.

I don't feel like I did anything, really. I just told you what there was.

*That's all it really is.*

Narrating a scene out loud is one way to engage in immersion, but often you can
have trouble finding the words. If you just let the world happen, and ask the
right questions, you can find more details than you thought possible. Take it
slow, let every detail sink in before moving on to the next one. If the scene
becomes scary, you ask it "what if we went this way instead". Sometimes it takes
that extra pair of paws to help guide it.
