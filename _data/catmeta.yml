    In the not-so-distant future, a project to make space travel slightly more
    palatable to human physiology accidentally produces a virulent plague of
    genetic alterations. The result, one in every hundred or so humans is
    transforming into a furrier version of themselves. These are their stories.

      Instead of trying to make every day sound interesting enough to journal,
      take a single moment and describe it in as much detail as possible. Use
      all the senses. Immerse the reader into that moment.
      
      Find the magic in the mundane.
